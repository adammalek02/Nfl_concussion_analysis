statistical analysis on some specific factor that may have an influence on the rate fo concusiions in the NFL


I started by importing two datasets: detailed concussion reports from 2012–2014 and game‐level logs from 2009–2017. I distilled the game logs down to unique date‐by‐game records so I could identify each matchup’s home and away teams and whether they played on grass or turf. After standardizing all team names to two‐letter codes, I merged the surface information into my concussion data—manually fixing a handful of mismatches—and built a tidy table with each injury’s date, player, position, home/away status, field type, and recovery metrics. From there, I summarized concussion counts by surface and position, calculated the average games missed post-injury, and visualized frequencies across teams. Finally, I ran a series of inferential tests: a binomial test to compare grass versus turf concussion counts, a logistic regression to see if position predicted surface type, a two-sample t-test to compare recovery time on grass and turf, and a follow-up logistic model with a Position × Games Missed interaction to evaluate whether combining role and severity improved model fit.
